Discussion was done on **model assumptions**, **interpretation**, **transformations**, **outlier detection**, **dummy variables** and **variable selection** procedures. Examples were drawn from biomedical literature and **R** was utilized for statistical analysis.

## Data Analysis Plan for Life Expectancy 

Collaborators: 

This project utilized data from [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/) & [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).  For this data analysis project, a subset of the data was used to focus on information available in years 2001 and 2019 and for a subset of variables from the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjshri23/life-expectancy-and-socio-economic-world-bank).

 Using the data `BIOST512-subset-LifeExpectancy.csv`, importing, cleaning, creation of factor variables and analysis was done using **Rstudio** and the packages, `psych`, `rigr`, `lattice`, `tidyverse`,`kableExtra`, `ggplot2`, `ggthemes`.
