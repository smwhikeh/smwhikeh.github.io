## Overview

This course focused on **data programming**. It was in many ways, similar to traditional programming courses but the focus was on topics that were more relevant for **data handling**. This included **data frames**, **selecting and filtering observations**, **computing summaries** and **making plots**. After finishing this course I understood the basics of programming such as **variables, loops, if/else and functions**. I was able to solve programming tasks with **R**, **load**, **save and manipulate data**. I was also able to **clean, merge and reshape datasets**. Finally I also created appealing **data visualizations**.
