    abstract = {The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) has generated a large repository of three-dimensional (3D) imaging data from mouse embryos, providing a rich resource for investigating phenotype/genotype interactions. While the data is freely available, the computing resources and human effort required to segment these images for analysis of individual structures can create a significant hurdle for research. In this paper, we present an open source, deep learning-enabled tool, Mouse Embryo Multi-Organ Segmentation (MEMOS), that estimates a segmentation of 50 anatomical structures with a support for manually reviewing, editing, and analyzing the estimated segmentation in a single application. MEMOS is implemented as an extension on the 3D Slicer platform and is designed to be accessible to researchers without coding experience. We validate the performance of MEMOS-generated segmentations through comparison to state-of-the-art atlas-based segmentation and quantification of previously reported anatomical abnormalities in a Cbx4 knockout strain.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.},
