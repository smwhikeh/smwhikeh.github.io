      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a **Master's in Public Health (MPH) Candidate** at the [University of Washington](https://globalhealth.washington.edu/) in the Department of Global Health specializing in **Biostatistics** and **Health Metric Sciences**. 

I completed my Bachelor's at the University of Washington where I double majored in [Human Evolutionary Biology](https://anthropology.washington.edu/human-evolutionary-biology-ba) and [Medical Anthropology & Global Health](https://anthropology.washington.edu/medical-anthropology-global-health-ba) with a minor in [Data Science](https://dataminor.uw.edu/).

My expertise includes **data extraction**, **disease modeling**, and **machine learning** applications in **biomedical data**. I am passionate about leveraging **data science** to inform **public health** interventions and focus on **equity and diversity**. In the future, I aspire to help generate **health metrics** and **data visualizations** that drive **global health research** and promote equitable health outcomes, particularly in **low and middle-income countries (LMICs)** and for **women, neonatal and child health (MNCH)**.
